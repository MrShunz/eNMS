    Multiprocessing allows work for multiple devices to run concurrently.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the checkbox to enable/disable multiprocessing for a service or workflow. The
    Maximum Number of Processes field controls the limit of how many devices can run
    concurrently. Higher concurrency makes sense for operations that spend a lot of time
    waiting for data from devices, lower concurrency for compute focused activities.
    Actual performance varies based on other activities running on the same system.

  <strong>Contexts where multiprocessing adds value</strong>

  <strong>Contexts where multiprocessing does not add value</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Service by service workflows</li>
    <li>Services or sub-workflows within a device by device workflow</li>
